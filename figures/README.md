# `figures/`

This folder contains the original figures for the paper, in `.pdf` and `.svg` format. These files are directly generated with the `equivator-figs.ipynb` jupyter notebook, contained in the parent folder of this one.

The mapping between figures and files is:

- `molecule.*`: Figure 1, results for a single water molecule
- `bulk-static.*`: Figure 2, results for liquid bulk water, in particular, the *static* properties
- `bulk-dyn.*`: Figure 3, bulk liquid water, but *dynamical* properties

In the supplement, the following additional figures appear:

- `frot-comparison.*`: Figure 1, the convergence of rotational error with averaging grid size
- `econs-drift.*`: Figure 2, drift of the conserved quantity in MD
- `bulk-static-rnd.*`: Figure 3, static properties for bulk water with a model that is randomly rotated instead of averaged
- `bulk-dyn-rnd.*`: Figure 4, dynamical properties
